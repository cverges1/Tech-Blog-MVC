  ## Description
  This project is a full stack application of a blog meant for developers.  The Web Development Tech Blog was created as a place for developers to post their thoughts and ideas in an effort to continue innovation.  This project was a great challenge in combing all the skills I have learned to this point. After completing this project I feel much more confident in my ability to design any full stack web app.
